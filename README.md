# React TypeScript Starter Kit with React Router

Welcome to the React TypeScript Starter Kit, a robust foundation for kickstarting your web development journey using React and TypeScript. This kit is configured with essential features, including React Router for navigation, TypeScript for static typing, and a modular project structure. Whether you're building a small website or a complex web application, this starter kit provides a solid starting point.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm: Installed with Node.js

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/udayaprakashjayaraman/reactjs-typescript-starter-kit.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd reactjs-typescript-starter-kit
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the App

Now that you have the project set up, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the app in your web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Project Structure

The project structure is organized to facilitate easy navigation and extension:

- `src`: Contains the source code for your React application.
  - `components`: Reusable components used across the app.
  - `pages`: Different pages of the application, including home and about pages.
  - `router`: React Router configuration.
  - `types`: TypeScript types and interfaces.
- `App.tsx`: The main entry point of the application.

### Navigation

#### React Router DOM
This project uses React Router DOM for navigation. The router setup is configured in the `src/router/AppRouter.tsx` file. You can easily add new routes and customize the navigation options according to your app's structure.

### Pages

The `src/pages` folder contains different pages of the application. Customize these pages based on your app's content and layout. The starter kit includes a basic Home page and an About page for demonstration.

### TypeScript Integration

TypeScript is integrated into the project to provide static typing and improve development workflows. You can find TypeScript types and interfaces in the `src/types` folder. Leverage TypeScript to catch errors early and enhance code readability.

### Enhancements

This starter kit is designed for easy enhancements. You can build upon the existing structure by adding more pages, components, and features. The modular and organized nature of the codebase allows for seamless integration of new functionalities.
